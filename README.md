# Blockchain with Python
## Module_18_Challenge



As a Fintech Engineer, my task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers).

## Purpose
* The purpose of this blockchain-based ledger system is for to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger

## Steps
• Create a Record Data Class
• Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
• Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
• Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records - see below screenshots of the streamlit applications.
